        I am <big>Shatha Alaa Al Sheikh Ali </big>,an enginner student , 
        I know very well that depending only on
       what I learn in my university will not lead to the end I want,
      which is being a great web devoloper , and being a part of Code
       Academy will build completely ready engineers and problems solvers,it 
      will for sure help us become successful web devolpers , four 
      months spent in this Academy will open many doors in front of us , lots of
      great chances and jobs will be waiting for us there, and even though I 
      think it will be so early to search for a job , this course will
      for sure help me the most whenever I want to get a job , and a person
       who knows how great <b>Gaza Sky Geeks </b>is, I really am longing
      for being a part of <b>Code Academy</b>.
